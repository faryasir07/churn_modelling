# Churn Modelling

## Overview
Churn modelling is a predictive analytics problem that aims to identify customers who are likely to leave a service or stop doing business with a company. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict churn probability.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of customer information, including demographics, account details, and transaction history. Typical features include:
- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Credit Score
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Is Active Member
- Estimated Salary
- Exited (Target Variable: 1 = Churn, 0 = No Churn)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing feature distributions
   - Understanding correlations
   - Identifying important factors influencing churn

3. **Model Training**
   - Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

4. **Model Evaluation & Optimization**
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Cross-validation
   - Feature importance analysis

5. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Creating a web or API-based interface for real-time churn prediction

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
- **MySQL** (Optional) for data storage
- **Flask/Django** (Optional) for deployment

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/faryasir07/churn_modelling.git
   cd churn_modelling
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results
- The trained model achieves an accuracy of **X%** (depends on your final results)
- Key factors affecting churn include **feature1, feature2, feature3**

## Future Improvements
- Improve feature engineering techniques
- Experiment with deep learning models
- Deploy the model as a web application
